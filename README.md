# Code of Three

Code of Three is a short puzzle-adventure game created in Unity for the Two Desperados Game Jam 2025.  
The theme of the jam was "Three Rules", and the challenge was to create a complete game from scratch within one week.  

In this game, the player must navigate through a series of rooms while following specific rules.  
Breaking a rule results in an immediate loss, while reaching the exit within the allowed limits leads to victory.  
The focus is on planning moves carefully and maintaining awareness of the rules at all times.

## Game Concept

You control a character that needs to reach the final door in the level.  
The twist is that you are limited by the Three Rules, which might restrict movement, actions, or available attempts.  
Each mistake leads to restarting the level.

The game ends when:
- A rule is broken.
- The exit door is reached.
- The allowed number of actions is exceeded.

## Controls

- W, A, S, D or Arrow Keys – Move the player.
- Mouse Click – Interact with UI buttons.

## How to Play

1. Start from the Main Menu and select a difficulty (currently only Easy mode is available).
2. Navigate through the rooms while following the rules.
3. Avoid breaking the rules or exceeding the limit of allowed moves.
4. Reach the final door to win.
